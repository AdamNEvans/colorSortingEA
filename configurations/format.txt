CATEGORY:             general

# output files
logFilename:          filepath of the log file
solutionFilename:     filepath of the solution file
mylogFilename:        filepath of my custom log file (global best fitness list)

# ======================================
# EA fields
nruns:                number of runs
nevals:               number of evals per run
seed:                 'true' for a time based seed, else the seed value

# when to terminate
#   0: terminate after nevals has been reached
#   1: terminate after ngenerations with no change in the best member's fitness
#      in addition to termination after nevals
terminationType:      when to terminate
ngenerations:         number of generations for terminationType 1

CATEGORY:               population
# ======================================
# Population configuration values

# which parent selection method to use
#   0: fitness proportional
#   1: over-selection
parentSelectionType:    which parent selection method to use

# which survivor selection method to use
#   0: truncation
#   1: k-tournament
survivorSelectionType:  which survivor selection method to use

populationSize:         population size for the 
numKids:                number of kids to create every generation

survivork:              tournament size for survivor selection method 1
treeHeight:             max height of trees at initialization
mutationChance:         mutation chance
parsimonyPressure:      float: the fitness modifier based on the number of
                        nodes in the evaluation tree according to the formula
                        below.
                        fitness = score + (parsimonyPressure * nodesInTree)
overSelectionPercent:   The percent of the population forming the top portion
                        that 80% of parents are taken from
